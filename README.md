Hello, my name is Robert and I live in Pittsburgh, PA. I am an aspiring web developer who is self-taught.
My projects are not perfect but I am a curious and driven person who continues to learn each and every day.
I know how to find the answers to questions I have and am capable of accepting help from others.
Finding web development and programming has been one of the more enriching experiences of my life and I am excited for what comes next!
